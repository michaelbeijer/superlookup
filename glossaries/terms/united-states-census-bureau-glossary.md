## Terms

| Dutch | English | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| First Mortgage | A mortgage having priority over all other voluntary liens against the property. A first mortgage gives the lender a first claim against the owner's rights in the property if the owner fails to meet the required payments on the mortgage. |  |
| Second Mortgage | A junior mortgage that ranks after a first mortgage in priority. Properties may have two, three, or more mortgages, deeds of trust, or land contracts, as liens at the same time. Legal priority would determine whether they are called a first, second, third, etc. lien. |  |
| Deed of Trust | An instrument used in many states in place of a mortgage. The difference between a mortgage and a deed of trust is that a deed of trust involves a third party, known as the trustee, who has technical title to the property. Trust deeds, trusts, mortgage bonds, and vendor's liens are similar terms used in various parts of the country. |  |
| Contract to Purchase | An arrangement for the sale of real estate whereby the buyer may use, occupy, and enjoy land, but no deed is given by the seller (and no title passes) until all or a specified part of the sale price has been paid. A purchaser who is buying the property by means of a contract to purchase may not consider himself/herself to be the owner since the seller actually has the title. However, for this survey, the purchaser is considered to be the owner. Contract for deed, land contract, purchase agreement, agreement of sale, and assumption agreement are similar terms used frequently in some areas of the country. |  |
| Home Equity Line of Credit | Allows the property owner to borrow against the equity in the home from time to time without reapplying for a loan. |  |
