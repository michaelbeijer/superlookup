# oocyte vs egg

## Terms

| Dutch | English | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| oocyte/ovocyte | an immature egg cell/ovum |  |
| egg (or ovum) | mature egg cell/ovum |  |
| <blockquote>“An oocyte is an immature egg cell. The oocyte will eventually break free from the follicle and travel down the fallopian tube – at which point it's called an egg (or ovum, if you're that way inclined). Once the egg gets fertilised by the sperm, it's a zygote.”</big><ref>[https | //theduff.co.uk/follicle-egg-zygote-difference-ivf/#:~:text=An%20oocyte%20is%20an%20immature,the%20sperm%2C%20it's%20a%20zygote. https://theduff.co.uk/follicle-egg-zygote-difference-ivf/#:~:text=An%20oocyte%20is%20an%20immature,the%20sperm%2C%20it's%20a%20zygote.]</ref></blockquote><blockquote>“A developing egg is called an oocyte. Its differentiation into a mature egg (or ovum) involves a series of changes whose timing is geared to the steps of meiosis in which the germ cells go through their two final, highly specialized divisions.”</big></blockquote><blockquote>“An oocyte (/ˈoʊəsaɪt/, oöcyte, or ovocyte is a female gametocyte or germ cell involved in reproduction. In other words, it is an immature ovum, or egg cell. An oocyte is produced in a female fetus in the ovary during female gametogenesis. The female germ cells produce a primordial germ cell (PGC), which then undergoes mitosis, forming oogonia. During oogenesis, the oogonia become primary oocytes. An oocyte is a form of genetic material that can be collected for cryoconservation.”</big></blockquote> |  |
