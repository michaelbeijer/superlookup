| IES File | A file format developed by the Illuminating Engineering Society (IES) of North America, used to store photometric data for lighting fixtures. It contains information such as the light distribution pattern, intensity, and colour of a particular luminaire. The IES file is used to simulate the lighting performance of a luminaire in a virtual environment, allowing for accurate lighting design and analysis. |  |
| ''M classes | '' Mainly roads with motorised traffic, such as main roads and thoroughfares. Evaluation is based on the luminance method taking the road surface into consideration. In addition to the average illumination density, the overall and longitudinal uniformity are used as quality characteristics, as well as the environment illuminance ratio REI and the glare percentage value fTI . |  |
| ''P classes | '' Roads with a low volume of traffic and low speeds, as well as areas for pedestrians and/or cyclists. Evaluation is based on the average and minimum degree of illuminance. |  |
| ''C classes | '' Conflict zones, such as areas where the flow of traffic is split, intersections and junctions. These also include roundabouts and pedestrian crossings. Evaluation is based on the average degree of illuminance and uniformity. |  |
| LED (Light Emitting Diode) | A semiconductor device that emits light when an electric current passes through it. LEDs are highly energy efficient, long-lasting, and have a wide range of applications in lighting, including general illumination, automotive lighting, and decorative lighting. |  |
| Safety Class is a classification system used to identify the degree of protection provided by an electrical device. It is based on the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard 60598 and is used to indicate the level of protection against electric shock, fire, and other hazards. Safety Class is divided into four categories | Class I, Class II, Class III, and Class IV. Class I devices are the most protected, providing the highest level of protection against electric shock, fire, and other hazards. Class II devices provide a lower level of protection, while Class III and Class IV devices provide the least protection. |  |
| UGR (Unified Glare Rating) | A metric used to measure the amount of discomfort glare in a lighting system. It is calculated by taking into account the luminance of the luminaire, the size of the luminaire, the distance of the luminaire from the observer, and the angle of the luminaire relative to the observer. UGR is used to ensure that lighting systems are designed to provide a comfortable and safe environment for occupants. |  |
