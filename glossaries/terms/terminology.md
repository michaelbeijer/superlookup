| Correct and consistent terminology is critical in technical translation, which is why I maintain what is possibly the world’s largest collection of specialist Dutch/English terminology, part of which is presented in a systematic and easily searchable format on this website. The data is organised using two main categories | ‘Terms’ and ‘Terminology resources’, which are explained below. |  |
| In my spare time, I also like to help colleagues with tricky terms in Proz.com’s so-called ‘KudoZ translation help network’, where I am often among the top ‘[https | //www.proz.com/?sp=leaders_new KudoZ point leaders]’ in my language pair. Indeed, if you’re struggling with a particular term, I may already have researched and documented it at some point, so feel free to drop me a line or try searching the [https://www.proz.com/search/?es=1 ProZ.com term search forums] or here on superlookup.wiki. |  |
| The ‘[[ | Category:Terms\|Terms]]’ category is relatively self-explanatory and refers to terms in the standard sense, such as ‘terminologist’ and ‘lexicographer’, each presented on a dedicated page, including definitions, translations, etc. The term pages contain my own research while translating. I basically use them as a notepad and memory aid, so a lot of the content will be quickly written and potentially far from perfect. If you find anything glaringly incorrect, feel free to drop me a line! |  |
