# Palletiser glossary (Palletizing.com)

## Terms

| Dutch | English | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Cap Sheet | A sheet that is placed on the top of a palletized load. |  |
| Case Stop | Barriers that are introduced between cases, cartons or packages in a row-forming conveyor to create spaces or gaps in the row and subsequently in the pattern. |  |
| Case Turner | A mechanism on a palletizer for changing the direction of a carton, case or package as needed to form a pattern. Also called a Turning Device. |  |
| Depalletizer | A machine that removes product from a unit load and places the product onto a conveyor. |  |
| Discharge Conveyor | A conveyor capable of receiving and transporting a pallet load or a unitized load of product from the palletizer or unitizer. |  |
| Electric Palletizer | A palletizer with an electric hoist rather than a hydraulic hoist. |  |
| Flight Bar | A device on a palletizer used to move a layer or row of product to the next section of the palletizer. |  |
| Floor Level Palletizer | A palletizer with a case infeed entry level of approximately 30 inches high. |  |
| Full Load Conveyor | A conveyor inside the palletizer that transports a full load out of the palletizing section to a discharge conveyor. |  |
| High Level Palletizer | A palletizer with a case infeed entry level of approximately 7 feet to 12 feet high. |  |
| Hoist | The mechanism on a palletizer by which a layer or load of product is raised or lowered to position the load to accept a layer of product or for discharge of the load. |  |
| Hydraulic Palletizer | A palletizer with a hydraulic hoist rather than an electric hoist. |  |
| Infeed | Conveyor on a palletizer where the product is turned to orient the product to make the patterns. |  |
| Layer | A single level horizontal arrangement of product formed in a pre-determined pattern. |  |
| Layer Guides | Vertical surfaces located above the stripper plate or apron that may be fixed or movable to locate the product for depositing. |  |
| Layer Pusher | A device on a palletizer used to move a layer of product to the stripper plate or apron. |  |
| Layer Table | A section of conveyor on a palletizer used to accumulate and hold a layer of product while other sections of palletizer continue to operate. |  |
| Load Inverter | A machine that transfers a unit load of product from one pallet type to another pallet type by inverting the palletized load. |  |
| Load Transfer Station | A machine that transfers a unit load of product from one pallet type to another pallet type by pushing the palletized load. View Load Transfer Systems Whitepaper and learn about effective pallet transfer. |  |
| Meter Belt | A belt located after the pacer belt on the palletizer that is used to meter product into the system creating gaps between the cases. |  |
| Pacer Belt | A belt located at the entrance to the palletizing system. It controls the pace of product entering the Palletizer. |  |
| Package Stop | Barriers that are introduced between cases, cartons or packages in a row-forming conveyor to create spaces or gaps. In the row package stops may be used to prevent cases from turning around each other when rows are advanced by row pusher chains or pusher bar. |  |
| Pallet Dispenser | A mechanism that can accept, hold, and discharge a pallet upon demand. |  |
| Pallet Retainers | A cam, dog or other element capable of holding a stack of pallets found in a pallet dispenser operating in conjunction with an elevating mechanism to release one pallet at a time. |  |
| Pallet Stacker | A machine that automatically receives and stacks pallets. |  |
| Pallet Stop | A device on a palletizer used to position a pallet so that it will be ready for its next operation. |  |
| Palletizer | A machine that assembles products in a predetermined pattern to form layers and sequentially deposits the layers on a pallet to build a unit load. |  |
| Pattern | The geometric arrangement of products to form a layer. |  |
| Pusher Bar | A bar that advances a completed row of product onto the layer forming section of a palletizer. |  |
| Pusher Chains | A chain that advances a completed row of product onto the layer forming section of a palletizer. |  |
| Robotic Palletizer | A machine that assembles products in a predetermined pattern to form layers and sequentially deposits the layers on a pallet to build a unit load. |  |
| Row Former | A conveyor on a palletizer used for accumulating product in a row as part of the process of forming a layer. |  |
| Row Forming Rolls | A conveyor on a palletizer used for accumulating product in the row forming area as part of the process of forming a layer. |  |
| Row Pusher | A device on a palletizer used to move a row of product to the next section of the palletizer. |  |
| Sheet Dispenser | A mechanism that contains a stack of sheets moving a sheet from the stack for placement under the load or between layers. |  |
| Slip Sheet | A sheet that is placed on a pallet prior to palletizing of product. |  |
| Stripper Apron | A set of idler rolls capable of supporting a layer of product and capable of moving horizontally to deposit a layer of product on the surface beneath the apron. |  |
| Stripper Plate | A metal plate capable of supporting a layer of product and capable of being moved horizontally to deposit a layer of product on the surface beneath the plate. |  |
| Systems Integration | Combines the palletizer with upstream and downstream equipment. |  |
| Tie Sheet | A sheet that is placed between layers of product on a palletized load. |  |
| Unitizer | A machine that assembles products in a predetermined pattern to form layers and sequentially deposits the layers on a slip sheet. |  |
