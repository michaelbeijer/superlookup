# Glossary of Terms (Brillopak.co.uk)

## Terms

| Dutch | English | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Automated packing system | A system that automatically places a product into a crate or tray. Also refers to bag filling systems such as form fill and seal which fills a bag or sack with product. |  |
| Case and crate packing systems | The latest developments in case/box handling equipment has seen the rise of robotic machines that are designed to fully automate the packing of pre-packed products into cases, trays or crates on new or existing production lines. These new units remove labour intensive operations, which can be a cause of repetitive strain injuries as well as a major cost. Many robotic systems offer efficiency through simplicity in terms of set-up, operation and maintenance. Robotics options include two axis robots for simple case loading; four axis robots for more complex case loading and palletising applications and high-speed automated pick and place robotics for volume operations. Integrated vision systems for product detection, orientation and quality control can also be offered to provide flexibility in case/pack handling and any future formats. |  |
| Case Palletiser | Palletiser specifically adapted to palletise sacks, which may work using the robot, gantry or low level palletiser principles. |  |
| crate Palletiser | Palletiser specifically adapted to palletise retail crates, which may work using the robot, gantry or low level palletiser principles. |  |
| Flow Wrap packing system | A system that automates the packing of flow wrap packs into retail crates and trays post flow wrapper. This typically results in a significant reduction in labour cost. |  |
| Gantry palletiser | Palletiser that comprises a gantry supporting a pick and place device which can be programmed in a number of ways to form a pallet load. The group packages may be moved individually, in rows or complete layers while the pallet remains in one position. Gantry palletisers will typically be similar in layout to a low-level palletiser but can also be in the form of a multi-position palletiser. |  |
| Layer Pad Inserter/Remover | Attachment typically integrated with a palletiser to place pads between layers of products as the load is formed to provide protection to the layer above or below. The same machine can be integrated with a depalletiser to remove layer pads and restack them as the load is dismantled. |  |
| Low Level Palletizing Machine | Palletiser which forms a layer of packages at one level, which is then transferred by clamping and then pushing the layer onto a stripper plate. Once loaded the stripper plate is raised or lowered to the appropriate level before the stripper plate is moved over the pallet. The layer is then transferred onto the pallet by holding the layer clamps in position while the stripper plate is withdrawn. The pallet remains at the same level while the load is being formed. Low level palletisers are suitable for palletizing all types of group packages. Low level palletisers take up more floor area than other designs of palletiser. |  |
| Pallet Magazine | Machine that dispenses empty pallets from a stack or accepts single empty pallets to place on a stack. Can be floor standing or in line. |  |
| Pallet Stacker/Unstacker | Machine which stacks or unsticks pallets. See pallet magazine. |  |
| Pallet Dispenser | Machine that dispenses pallets onto the line. |  |
| Palletizing Machines | Packaging machines that form pallet loads or loading units e.g. dollies of groups of packages or rigid containers. |  |
| Robot Palletiser | Palletiser, based on a multi-axis industrial robot, which can be programmed to form different pallet patterns dependent on the application. The packages may be moved individually, in rows or complete layers while the pallet remains in one position. Packages are picked up by robot end effectors which may be of a gripper, clamp or combination. Control is by touch screen HMI and pendent. |  |
| Robotic pick and place | Robot pick and place systems automatically pick up individual or groups of products pre-packed and unpacked and place into a case or retail crate. |  |
| Sack palletiser | Palletiser specifically adapted to palletise sacks, which may work using the robot, gantry or low level palletiser principles. |  |
| Tray Seal packing system | A system that automates the packing of tray seal (e.g. punnets) products into retail crates and trays post tray sealer. This typically results in a significant reduction in labour cost. |  |
| Vertical Form Fill Seal (VFFS) packing system | A system that automates the packing of VFFS product packs into retail crates and trays. This typically results in a significant reduction in labour cost. |  |
