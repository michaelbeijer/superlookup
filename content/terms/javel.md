# javel

## Dutch / French-derived usage

**javel**  
In technical Dutch (especially Belgian Dutch), *javel* refers to an **aqueous solution of sodium hypochlorite**, commonly used as a **disinfectant, oxidising agent, or cleaning chemical**.

The term originates from French *eau de Javel* and is widely used in:
- wastewater treatment,
- membrane installations (CIP),
- industrial cleaning processes.

## English

### Preferred translation (technical / patent)

- **sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl)**

This is the **chemically precise and patent-safe term**, and should be used in:
- patents,
- engineering documentation,
- wastewater treatment descriptions,
- membrane cleaning procedures.

### Acceptable alternatives (context-dependent)

- **hypochlorite solution** – technical shorthand  
- **bleach** – acceptable where the functional role is emphasised rather than chemical specification  
- **chlorine bleach** – only if distinction from non-chlorine bleaches is relevant

---

## Usage notes

- **Do not translate *javel* as “chlorine”** — this is chemically incorrect and overly vague.
- In patents, **sodium hypochlorite** is preferred even when *javel* appears in the source text.
- Where the source lists *“natriumhypochloriet of javel”*, it is acceptable to translate this as  
  *“sodium hypochlorite or bleach”* to reflect both the chemical and colloquial designations.
