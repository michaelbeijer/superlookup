# (Neder)brackets

Dutch authors have a particular way of **(ab)using brackets** in technical, legal and semi-technical writing.  
This page documents and analyses these constructions, which I refer to as **(Neder)brackets**.

They are a frequent source of ambiguity and mistranslation when Dutch texts are rendered into English.

The clearest discussion of this phenomenon can be found in *‘Righting English that’s gone Dutch’* by **Joy Burrough-Boenisch**, in the chapter *‘Bracket (ab)use’*.

## Brackets in English vs Dutch

### English usage (normal)

In English, brackets are used to:

- explain  
- clarify  
- comment  

They are **parenthetical and secondary**. Removing the bracketed text should leave a complete and coherent sentence.

Example:
> *mapping functionality (semi-autonomous)*

This means:
- mapping functionality  
- with a clarification: it is semi-autonomous

---

### Dutch usage (problematic)

In Dutch technical writing, brackets are often used to **save space**, not to clarify.

They frequently pack **two meanings into one term**, for example:

- alternatives  
- scope extensions  
- optional inclusions  

This is where problems arise in translation.

Example:
> *(semi-)autonome mappingfunctionaliteit*

This does **not** necessarily mean the same thing as the English parenthetical form.

---

## The two possible interpretations

Every instance of a Nederbracket must be analysed using **two competing interpretations**:

### 1. Dutch-style interpretation  
*(two meanings packed into one term)*

The bracketed element is **optional or additive**, meaning:

- X and/or Y  
- X or Y  
- X including Y  

### 2. English-style interpretation  
*(bracket as clarification)*

The bracketed element **narrows or explains** the main term.

The translator’s task is to determine **which interpretation the author intended**.

---

## Worked examples

### Example 1: `(semi-)autonome mappingfunctionaliteit`

**Dutch-style (most common in patents):**
- autonome mappingfunctionaliteit **en/of** semi-autonome mappingfunctionaliteit  

**English translation:**
- *autonomous mapping functionality and/or semi-autonomous mapping functionality*  
- *autonomous or semi-autonomous mapping functionality*

**English-style (less common):**
- mapping functionality, specifically semi-autonomous  

**English translation:**
- *autonomous mapping functionality, specifically semi-autonomous mapping functionality*

---

### Example 2: `(roer)bakken`

**Dutch-style:**
- bakken en/of roerbakken  

**English translation:**
- *frying and/or stir-frying*

**English-style:**
- bakken, specifically roerbakken  

**English translation:**
- *frying; specifically stir-frying*

---

### Example 3: `(afval)water`

This is extremely common in environmental and wastewater texts.

**Dutch-style (very common):**
- afval en/of afvalwater  

**Correct English resolution:**
- *waste and/or wastewater*

**English-style (rare in practice):**
- water, specifically wastewater  

**Translation:**
- *water (specifically wastewater)*

👉 In technical English, **explicitly spelling out the scope** is almost always preferable.

## Typical Nederbracket patterns and safe resolutions

### Scope-expanding brackets

| Dutch | Intended meaning | Safe English |
|------|------------------|--------------|
| (afval)water | waste and/or wastewater | waste and/or wastewater |
| (bio)brandstoffen | fuels and/or biofuels | biofuels (if clearly intended) |
| (internationale) bedrijfsbezoeken | national and/or international visits | national and international company visits |
| (her)configureren | configure or reconfigure | configure or reconfigure |

---

### Narrowing / clarifying brackets

| Dutch | Intended meaning | English |
|------|------------------|--------|
| (gedeeltelijke) sloop | sloop, maar gedeeltelijk | partial demolition |
| (lokale) regelgeving | regelgeving, lokaal | local regulations |
| (financiële) gegevens | gegevens, financieel | financial information |

---

### Ambiguous or dangerous cases

These require **careful contextual analysis** and often cannot be resolved mechanically:

- `(kern)waarden`
- `(mogelijk) probleem`
- `(on)belangrijk`
- `(on)veiligheidsgevoel`
- `(na)bloeiend`

In such cases, translators should:
1. Analyse the surrounding context  
2. Decide whether scope is being expanded or narrowed  
3. Rewrite explicitly in English  

---

## Translation strategy (recommended)

### General rule

> **If a Dutch bracket expands scope, spell it out explicitly in English.**  
> **If it clarifies or narrows meaning, rephrase without brackets.**

### What to avoid in English

- copying Dutch brackets verbatim  
- constructions like *waste(water)* or *semi(-)autonomous*  
- relying on the reader to infer scope  

These are **unidiomatic** and sometimes legally risky.

---

## Practical takeaway

Dutch Nederbrackets are:
- compact
- ambiguous
- context-dependent

English translations must be:
- explicit
- unpacked
- legally and technically precise

When in doubt, **spell it out**.
