| Definition | The area to which sewage is distributed for infiltration to the soil by means of a network of pipes. An area in which perforated piping is laid in drain rock-packed trenches, or excavations (seepage beds) for the purpose of distributing the effluent from a wastewater treatment unit. Synonyms and variations in implementation, trench vs. bed, for example, have given rise to a number of terms which people use loosely to refer to the soil absorption system or "SAS" including drainage trenches , septic drainfield, septic drainage field, septic system drainage bed, septic leachfield, septic leaching field, soakaway bed leaching bed, onsite sewage facility seepage bed, and similar terms. |  |

| Definition | Trench excavated around a septic field, having a positive outlet, which collects and diverts ground water and surface water away from a disposal field. The drain is necessary where a designated septic area is subject to an excessive influx of water that may interfere with the functioning of the disposal field. If the disposal field trenches fill with ground water, and the effluent cannot perk into the soil, a failure may occur. A subsurface drain designed and constructed to control groundwater and surface water intrusion into the area of the sewage system. Curtain drains or intercept drains can protect septic drainfield in areas of wet soils or surface and subsurface groundwater. |  |
| URL | [url]https://store.waterpumpsupply.com/septictankterms.html[/url] |  |
| Definition | Soils that have been mechanically altered by man. The upper portion of the natural soil has been removed, typically with a bulldozer, from the site. Cut soils are generally not suitable for septic system use, because the best part of the soil has been removed and the lower portions of the soil that are now exposed to the ground surface is clay, which does not perk. |  |
| URL | [url]https://store.waterpumpsupply.com/septictankterms.html[/url] |  |

| URL | [url]https://store.waterpumpsupply.com/septictankterms.html[/url] |  |
| Definition | Component of a conventional septic system used to equally divide and distribute effluent to the individual disposal field trenches. It is important that a distribution box not be disturbed or moved after it is in place. Any disturbance of the box may alter its ability to function properly (i.e. to equally distribute the incoming effluent) and cause a system to fail. |  |
| URL | [url]https://store.waterpumpsupply.com/septictankterms.html[/url] |  |

Also referred to as "distribution box" or "D-box", this component connects a single effluent line leaving the septic tank or other wastewater treatment component to the network of effluent distribution lines in an absorption area. |  |
| URL | [url]https://store.waterpumpsupply.com/septictankterms.html[/url] |  |
| Definition | The perforated pipe used to distribute wastewater to the absorption area. |  |
| URL | [url]https://store.waterpumpsupply.com/septictankterms.html[/url] |  |
| Definition | A system using mechanical means (bell siphon, tipping bucket, float valves) or electrically controlled means (electric pumps and pressure distribution systems) to first accumulate septic effluent in a dosing chamber or "distribution chamber" and then, when a specified volume of effluent has been collected, move that "dose" of effluent to the soil absorption system (sand filter bed, drain field, or other system) for final treatment, filtering, and dispersal. By buffering septic effluent and dispensing it only at when a specified volume has been collected, permit the drain field to "rest" between applications and can permit use of alternating drainfields. Dosing systems may extend the life of a drain field. Dosing systems may disperse effluent to the absorption system on specific time intervals but more commonly it is dispersed when a specific volume of effluent has been accumulated. |  |
| URL | [url]https://store.waterpumpsupply.com/septictankterms.html[/url] |  |
| Definition | A tank which collects treated wastewater for period of time and then, periodically, discharges it into another treatment unit or disposal unit, depending upon the needs and design of the particular on-site sewage system. |  |
| URL | [url]https://store.waterpumpsupply.com/septictankterms.html[/url] |  |
| Definition | An area in which perforated piping is laid in drain rock-packed trenches, or excavations (seepage beds) for the purpose of distributing the effluent from a wastewater treatment unit |  |

| URL | [url]https://store.waterpumpsupply.com/septictankterms.html[/url] |  |
| Definition | A drywell is a pit or hole in the ground, open to soil at its sides and bottoms, intended to receive and dispose of gray water (water from building non-sewage drains such as laundry, showers, sinks). A drywell or "seepage pit" is used at some building sites to receive "gray water" from a laundry, sink, or shower. The pit may be site-built of stone or dry-laid concrete block, rubble-filled, or constructed of (safer) pre-cast concrete. |  |
| URL | [url]https://store.waterpumpsupply.com/septictankterms.html[/url] |  |
| Definition | For septic system reliability, in a mound or other advanced septic system which requires the use of a pump, two pumps are employed using one of two methods. (1) the pumps alternate or "take turns" in pumping out effluent under control of a float switch. This method has the advantage of constantly testing that both pumps work and of distributing the work and thus the wear-out cycle across the equipment. (2) the pumps come on at different levels of effluent in a pumping chamber. This method holds one pump in reserve, causing it to operate only if the effluent level rises above a certain point. In this design, if the inflow into the system exceeds the capacity of the first pump or if the first pump fails, the second pump goes to work. In good design, if one of the two pumps stops working, an alarm is sounded on the system. |  |
| URL | [url]https://store.waterpumpsupply.com/septictankterms.html[/url] |  |
| Definition | Septic dye tests involve flushing a special florescent dye down a toilet or other drain. The dye itself does not make anything happen. It is simply a colored indicator that can identify water found outside as having come from the fixture where the dye was introduced. It's the volume of water introduced into the system that forms the actual "test". If waste water is coming to the surface (an unsanitary condition indicating serious septic failure) one may see dye in that water, provided the septic system is flowing at common rates. |  |
| URL | [url]https://store.waterpumpsupply.com/septictankterms.html[/url] |  |
| Definition | A measure of the diameter of soil particles, when compared to a theoretical material having an equal transmission constant. It is the dimensions of that mesh screen which will permit 10 percent of the sample to pass and will retain 90 percent. |  |
| URL | [url]https://store.waterpumpsupply.com/septictankterms.html[/url] |  |
| Definition | Abbreviated term for Sewage Effluent. Septic effluent is the clarified, partially treated liquid which leaves a septic tank. Large solids have been separated by settlement, by floating to coagulate in a grease and scum layer, or by filtration or other methods. Septic effluent moves out of a septic treatment tank into an absorption system (or other effluent treatment system) for further treatment and ultimate disposal or discharge to the environment. |  |
| URL | [url]https://store.waterpumpsupply.com/septictankterms.html[/url] |  |
| Definition | Component of a conventional septic system used to intercept the effluent pumped to a disposal field and reduce the energy level of the pumped sewage water before it enters an alternating valve or the first disposal field trench. |  |

| Definition | Describes alternative septic systems. |  |
| URL | [url]https://store.waterpumpsupply.com/septictankterms.html[/url] |  |
| Definition | Evaporation-Transpiration (ET) Septic Systems and Evapo-Transpiration Absorption Septic Systems (ETA) dispose of septic effluent from the septic tank by providing a surface area intended to allow the effluent to evaporate. ET systems depend entirely on evaporation while ETA systems make use of both evaporation and (limited) soil absorption of septic effluent. |  |

| URL | [url]https://store.waterpumpsupply.com/septictankterms.html[/url] |  |
| Definition | Describes the conditions that occur when a septic system is no longer functioning properly, and the sewage water from the septic tank begins to pond on the ground surface over one or more components of the system. Some factors that may cause a septic system to fail include: the age of the septic system (25 years old or older); excessive water use; damage to the disposal field area; broken pump; crushed crossover pipe; and broken tight line. |  |

| URL | [url]https://store.waterpumpsupply.com/septictankterms.html[/url] |  |
| Definition | Used to control (turn on and off) a sewage effluent pump. The switch is housed within a plastic bulb that is connected to the pump by a wire. The bulb floats at the surface of the sewage water within the pump tank, and when the water level rises to a predetermined level, the switch mechanism within the plastic bulb activates the pump. Once the water has been lowered to a predetermined level by the pump, the switch mechanism automatically turns the pump off. |  |

| Definition | Water used in the household plumbing fixtures--sinks, bathtubs, showers, clothes and dish washing machines, etc.--other than a toilet. A common misconception is that gray water is benign and can simply be discharged onto the ground or in a creek without harm. In fact, gray water contains bacteria that are washed from our bodies and the clothes we wear, and also food wastes (i.e. kitchen sinks). Thus, gray water can create a health hazard if it is not properly disposed, either into a sewer system or a properly constructed septic system. |  |

| URL | [url]https://store.waterpumpsupply.com/septictankterms.html[/url] |  |
| Definition | Describes the degree of sanitization of wastewater that occurs as wastewater passes through a treatment system. It is a scale of the level of water pollution which ranges from an OTL of 0% (or 10 on a pollution scale) (untreated raw sewage effluent) to an OTL of 100% (or 0 on a pollution scale). An OTL of 100% means that the output of the treatment system has produced water of the same quality as drinking water. While drinking water standards vary among various states, provinces, and countries, drinking water standards specify the level of allowable bacteria (such as less than one CFU per 100 ml of water) as well as the allowable levels of nitrites, nitrates, and a long list of common chemical contaminants. The U.S. EPA National Primary Drinking Water Standards list 87 contaminants that must be tested in approving water for human consumption. All of these need to be addressed by the wastewater treatment system. The typical OTL of an onsite wastewater treatment system is required to discharge effluent which is at least as clean as normally-occurring groundwater. Some treatment systems produce a lower OTL and require disinfection. Other wastewater treatment systems produce water which is cleaner than local groundwater. |  |

| Definition | A hole, 5-7 feet deep is dug in an area to be tested for future use as a drain field, or near the drain-field area in representative soils. Water is poured into the hole and the soils or septic engineer or contractor observes the rate at which soil absorbs the water by noting the time that it takes for the level of water in the hole to drop one inch (for example). More precise "perc tests" may involve using a specific quantity of water or a hold of specific dimensions to make these observations. Usually two holes are dug, 50' to 100' apart in order to evaluate the proposed septic leachfield area. Evidence of the seasonal high water table is noted (possibly based on changes in soil color at various depths). For safety, perc test holes must be re-filled after the test is complete. If the hole must be left open and unattended during the test it should be barricaded to prevent anyone from falling in. |  |

| Definition | The rate at which soil absorbs water. The perk rate is measured in a standardized unit of Minutes Per Inch (see Minutes Per Inch). Perk rates less than 15 MPI and greater than 105 MPI are too fast and too high, respectively, to permit the installation of a septic system. A high soil perk rate indicates that the sewage water is not sufficiently filtered by the soil and may subsequently contaminate the groundwater under such soil areas. A low soil perk rate indicates that a septic field installed in such a soil may not be able to absorb the sewage water and a failure may result. |  |

| Definition | A wastewater treatment system such as an aerobic treatment unit (ATU), because it involves a tank filled with wastewater and forced oxygenation of that wastewater, is a type of saturated wastewater treatment system. Other non-saturated wastewater treatment systems such as trickling filter beds use passively-infused air to support their oxygen-supported microorganisms. Unlike ATUs, non-saturated systems allow passive air contact with effluent as it moves through the media. Air is not being pumped. Both types of systems make use of aerobic microorganisms. |  |

| Definition | A septic tank is a closed container which receives blackwater or sewage from a building, normally as the first step in onsite wastewater treatment. The purpose of the treatment tank or "septic tank" is to contain solid waste and to permit the beginning of bacterial action to process sewage into a combination of clarified effluent, settled sludge, or floating scum in the tank. An intact, un-damaged septic tank is normally always filled with these materials. A watertight pretreatment receptacle receiving the discharge of sewage from a building sewer or sewers, designed and constructed to permit separation of settleable and floating solids from the liquid, detention and anaerobic digestion of the organic matter, prior to discharge of the liquid |  |
| URL | [url]https://store.waterpumpsupply.com/septictankterms.html[/url] |  |
| Definition | Water-tight, pre-cast concrete receptacle that receives and holds the sewage generated through the use of water in a structure. The purpose of the septic tank is to 1) receive the incoming sewage from the structure; 2) allow for the solid organic material portions of the sewage to settle to the bottom of the tank; and 3) allow the lighter than water material portions of the sewage (i.e. domestic oils and grease) to float to the upper surface of the water level in the tank. The process of the separation of the sewage components is called clarification. An internal arrangement of baffles in the tank allows only the clarified sewage, or sewage effluent, to flow out of the tank. The effluent then flows through a tight line either to a pump tank or directly to the disposal field. |  |

| Definition | Person specifically licensed to remove and properly dispose of the contents of a domestic septic tank. The term pumper assumingly comes from the manner which is used to remove the septic tank contents. The pumping contractor has a large truck with a large, 1000 to 2000-gallon capacity, steel tank mounted on the vehicle. A powerful vacuum pump is connected to the steel tank. When the pump is activated, a sufficient suction force is generated so that the sewage contents of the septic tank can be drawn through a large diameter flexible pipe into the steel tank on the truck and thus removed for disposal. |  |

Typically the septic tilt switch is located in a steel container or "can" (to prevent interference from solid waste) or may be encased in an epoxy block (to protect the switch and make it waterproof] and is used to control a septic effluent pump. Tilt switches work by gravity (and changes in the liquid level in a tank) to turn a pump on or off. Where the tilt switch is affixed to a levered float which moves up or down (tilts) in response to changes in the liquid level in a tank, it may also be called a float switch. |  |

| Definition | The combination of human and household waste with water which is discharged to the home plumbing system including the waste from a flush toilet, bath, sink, lavatory, dishwashing or laundry machine, or the water-carried waste from any other fixture, equipment or machine. Any urine, feces, and the water carrying human wastes, including kitchen, bath, and laundry wastes from residences, building, industrial establishments or other places. For the purposes of typical BOH guidelines, "sewage" is generally synonymous with domestic wastewater. Water-carried wastes discharged from a plumbing collection system from residences, buildings and commercial and industrial establishments. Since all water-carried waste is considered to be sewage, there is no distinction between gray water and black water. Thus, in a dwelling or structure served by a septic system, all wastewater must be directed to the septic tank for disposal through the septic field. |  |

| Definition | Like a probe, an auger provides a column of soil for viewing when extracted. Auger diameters are typically larger than probes, and extensions can be added to access deeper into the soil. An auger produces larger samples and is more effective in rocky areas than a probe, although it still may be difficult to use due to rocks. Some disadvantages are that the auger is slower and more labor intensive and the disturbed nature of the sample may not reveal faint mottles, cemented layers, or structure." |  |

| Definition | A dug-out area near the perimeter of an expected drainfield area. Do not dig a pit within the proposed drainfield area, as soil can settle after the system has been installed, disrupting the distribution lines. Sunshine should reach the sidewall during the observation period so subtle differences in soil color will be most visible. Soil pits provide the best method for viewing both undisturbed soil and how soil varies over the depth of the pit. Pits may be the only reliable method to determine depth to bedrock. |  |

| Definition | A hollow tube that, when pushed into the soil and extracted, gives an undisturbed column of soil for viewing. Probes vary in length and diameter. Usually extensions can be added to probe deeper into the soil. It is the quickest method of looking at soil, and also allows you to detect faint soil mottling or cemented layers. Disadvantages are the relatively small diameter of the sample and inability to penetrate soil in rocky areas or under very dry conditions. |  |
