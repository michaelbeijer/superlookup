| '''Contexts | ''' Computer Vision, 3D Modeling, Statistics, Data Visualization. |  |
| '''English Translation | ''' Point cloud |  |
| '''Definition | ''' A set of data points in a 3D coordinate system (X, Y, Z), usually defined by lasers (LiDAR) or photogrammetry, representing the external surface of an object. |  |
| '''Key Collocations | ''' ''Driedimensionale puntenwolk'' (3D point cloud), ''Points in space'', ''Triangulation''. |  |
| '''English Translation | ''' Scatter plot / Scatter diagram / Dot diagram |  |
| '''Definition | ''' A graph in which the values of two variables are plotted along two axes, the pattern of resulting points revealing any correlation present. |  |
| '''Nuance | ''' In Dutch, ''puntenwolk'' is often used to describe the "cloud" of data points inside the chart. |  |
| '''Key Collocations | ''' ''Correlatie'' (correlation), ''Regressie'' (regression), ''Spreidingsdiagram'' (scatter plot). |  |
| '''The Dictionary Trap | Many general technical dictionaries map ''puntenwolk'' directly to ''scatter diagram'' or ''dot diagram''. This is correct only''' for statistics. |  |
| '''The Patent Rule | In patent texts regarding scanners, cameras, or surface reconstruction, ''puntenwolk'' MUST be translated as point cloud'''. |  |
| * ''Wrong | '' "The scanner generates a 3D scatter plot of the food product." |  |
| * ''Right | '' "The scanner generates a 3D point cloud of the food product." |  |
| [https | //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_cloud English Wikipedia (Point cloud)]: "A discrete set of data points in space." |  |
| [https | //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scatter_plot English Wikipedia (Scatter plot)]: "A type of plot or mathematical diagram using Cartesian coordinates to display values for typically two variables." |  |
