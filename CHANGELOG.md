## Migration Notes

### From MediaWiki to Static Site

The Beijerterm project was migrated from a self-hosted MediaWiki instance to a static site on GitHub Pages. This provides:

1. **Zero hosting costs** - GitHub Pages is free
2. **Better performance** - Static HTML loads faster than dynamic wiki
3. **Version control** - All content changes tracked in Git
4. **Community contributions** - Easy to submit PRs to add/fix terminology
5. **Offline capability** - Site can be downloaded and used offline

### Content Structure

```
glossaries/
├── agriculture/     # Agriculture terminology
├── automotive/      # Automotive/vehicle terms
├── aviation/        # Aviation/aerospace
├── chemistry/       # Chemistry/chemical engineering
├── construction/    # Construction/building
├── energy/          # Energy/utilities
├── financial/       # Finance/accounting
├── food/            # Food industry
├── general/         # General/miscellaneous
├── it/              # Information technology
├── legal/           # Legal/law
├── medical/         # Medical/healthcare
├── technical/       # Technical/engineering
└── textile/         # Textile industry
```

Each `.md` file contains:
- YAML frontmatter (title, slug, languages, term_count, etc.)
- Markdown table with terminology (Dutch | English | Notes)

### Build Process

1. `scripts/build_site.py` reads all Markdown files
2. Generates HTML pages for index, glossaries, and terms
3. Creates search index JSON
4. Copies static assets (CSS, icons)
5. GitHub Actions runs Pagefind to index content
6. Site deployed to GitHub Pages
